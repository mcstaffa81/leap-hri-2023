Ginevra Castellano is a Professor in Intelligent Interactive Systems at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, where she leads the Uppsala Social Robotics Lab. Her research interests are in the areas of social robotics and human-robot interaction, and include social learning, personalized adaptive robots, multimodal behaviours and robot ethics. She has published more than 100 research papers on these topics. She was the coordinator of the EU FP7 EMOTE (EMbOdied-perceptive Tutors for Empathy-based learning) project (2012–2016). She was the recipient of a Swedish Research Council Starting Grant (2016–2020). She is the PI for Uppsala University of several EU and national research projects, including, among others, the EU Horizon 2020 ANIMATAS (Advancing intuitive human-machine interaction with human-like social capabilities for education in schools; 2018-2021) project, the COIN (Co-adaptive human-robot interactive systems) project, funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (2016–2021), and the project "The ethics and social consequences of AI & caring robots. Learning trust, empathy and accountability" (2020-2024), supported by the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, Sweden, in the WASP-HS program (Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program– Humanities and Society). Castellano was a General Chair at IVA 2017 and will be a General Chair at HRI 2023. She is an Associate Editor of Frontiers in Robotics and AI and the ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction. Castellano is the recipient of the 10-Year Technical Impact Award at the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction 2019 and the Frontiers in Robotics and AI 2021 Outstanding Associate Editor Award.

PANELISTS

- [Sam Barrett](https://sam.barrettnexus.com/), *Sony AI*
{% include figure.html img="SamBarrett.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Sam joined Sony AI in 2019 as a senior research scientist, when Sony AI acquired Cogitai. Sam works on combining artificial intelligence and games using reinforcement learning. He previously worked at Amazon Robotics using AI to improve the performance of the robotics system inside Amazon's warehouses. He received his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Texas at Austin in October 2014. His dissertation examined the problem of ad hoc teamwork and cooperating with unknown teammates by exploiting previously learned knowledge. In addition, he helped the UT Austin Villa team win the 2012 international RoboCup competition in the standard platform league (SPL). Before joining UT, Sam received his B.S. in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in May 2008.

Benjamin Burchfiel is a Research Scientist at Toyota Research Institute where he serves as Technical Team Lead for the Robot Lifelong Learning Project. His work explores the intersection of robotics, computer vision, simulation, and machine learning to create robots capable of adapting to changes in their surroundings. Benjamin holds a BSc from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an MSc and PhD from Duke University. Prior to his time at TRI, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University. Benjamin was also a member of the Duke University Amazon Picking Challenge team and has interned at MIT and Aurora Innovation.

- [Kate Darling](http://www.katedarling.org/), *MIT Media Lab*
{% include figure.html img="kate-cropped.png" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Dr. Kate Darling is a Research Specialist at the MIT Media Lab and author of The New Breed: What Our History with Animals Reveals about Our Future with Robots. Her interest is in how technology intersects with society. Kate’s current work looks at the near-term effects of robotic technology, with a particular interest in law, social, and ethical issues. She has also explored economic issues in intellectual property systems. She runs experiments, holds workshops, writes, and speaks about some of the more interesting developments in the world of human-robot interaction, and where we might find ourselves in the future.
