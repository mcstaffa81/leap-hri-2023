Hatice Gunes is a Professor of Affective Intelligence and Robotics (AFAR) and the Head of the AFAR Lab at the University of Cambridge's Department of Computer Science and Technology. Her expertise is in the areas of affective computing and social signal processing cross-fertilising research in multimodal interaction, computer vision, signal processing, machine learning and social robotics. She has published over 125 papers in these areas (H-index=34, citations > 6,000),  with  most  recent  works  on lifelong learning for facial expression recognition, fairness, and affective  robotics;  and  longitudinal  HRI  for  wellbeing.  She was one of the Guest Editors of the 2021 IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing  Special  Issue  on  Automated  Perception  of  Human Affect   from   Longitudinal   Behavioral   Data.   Other research highlights  include  RSJ/KROS  Distinguished  Interdisciplinary Research Award Finalist at IEEE RO-MAN’21, Distinguished PC  Award  at  IJCAI’21,  Best  Paper  Award  Finalist  at  IEEERO-MAN’20, Finalist for the 2018 Frontiers Spotlight Award, Outstanding  Paper  Award  at  IEEE  FG’11,  and  Best  Demo Award at IEEE ACII’09. Prof Gunes is the former President of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC), and was the General Co-Chair of ACII’19, and the Program Co-Chair of ACM/IEEE HRI’20 and IEEE FG’17. She was a member of the Human-Robot Interaction Steering Committee (2018-2021) and the Chair of the Steering Board of IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing (2017-2019). In 2019 she was awarded the prestigious EPSRC Fellowship as a personal grant to investigate adaptive robotic emotional intelligence for wellbeing and was named a Faculty Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute e–UK’s national centre for data science and artificial intelligence (2019-2021). Prof Gunes is a Staff Fellow of Trinity Hall, a Senior Member of the IEEE and a member of the AAAC.
