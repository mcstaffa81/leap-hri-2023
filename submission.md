## Submission Guidelines



We invite papers of 3-4 pages (plus additional pages for references and appendices), including work in progress containing preliminary results, technical reports, case studies, surveys and state-of-the-art research in lifelong learning and personalization in a variety of fields (e.g., education, rehabilitation, elderly care, collaborative tasks, customer-oriented service and companion robots) and long-term studies. Papers will be reviewed for their relevance, novelty, and scientific and technical soundness.

Submissions do not need to be anonymized for review. All manuscripts must be written in English and submitted electronically in PDF format via EasyChair (link given at the top). The accepted papers will be published on the workshop website, as well as in arXiv.

Authors should use the IEEE template files (US letter): [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)

## Topics of Interest

We encourage researchers and students from HRI, robotics, cognitive science, rehabilitation and educational backgrounds to contribute.

The workshop welcomes contributions across a wide range of topics including, but not limited to:

- Lifelong personalization and/or adaptation
- Modelling user(s) and/or user behavior(s) in multi-session/long-term HRI
- Modelling robot behavior in multi-session/long-term HRI
- Modelling context in multi-session/long-term HRI
- Agent/robot architectures for personalization/adaptation
- Lifelong (long-term) human-agent or multi-user/multi-agent interactions
- Lifelong (long-term) multimodal interactions
- Continual/lifelong machine learning
- Long-term memory (episodic, semantic, associative)
- Privacy and ethical considerations in lifelong learning/personalization in HRI
